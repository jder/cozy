[ from Sarah ]
- i was going to say Improvement: make the mayor's bed interactable so i can lay in it and she gets mad and tells me it's weird
- also why is there a bed in the mayor's office
- cultists come back after big story fight, seems weird
- definitely harder at the beginning than at the end
