# Egg Engine

A generic game engine. For now this is pretty hacked together. Things might get better in the future!


## Plans

Do I look someone who is planning things in advance?

Really though, the plan is to take my hacked together pile of crap and make small games with them (the example games) to figure out what I actually need in the engine and how I actually want things to look and to work. Over time I will update and replace pieces as necessary. If you've somehow gotten access to this repository, hopefully I've actually given it to you and you know what's up.
